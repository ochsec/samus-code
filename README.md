# Samus Code

![Samus Code Screenshot](./docs/assets/samus-screenshot.png)

Samus Code is a command-line AI workflow tool adapted from [**Qwen Code**](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code) (Please refer to [this document](./README.gemini.md) for more details), optimized for working with local LLM models with enhanced parser support & tool support.

## Key Features

- **Code Understanding & Editing** - Query and edit large codebases beyond traditional context window limits
- **Workflow Automation** - Automate operational tasks like handling pull requests and complex rebases
- **Enhanced Parser** - Adapted parser specifically optimized for Samus-Coder models

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.

```bash
curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ochsec/samus-code.git
cd samus-code
npm install
npm install -g .
```

Then run from anywhere:

```bash
samus
```

### API Configuration
